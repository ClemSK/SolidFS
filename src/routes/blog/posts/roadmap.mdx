At some point I'm going to add a kanban board of some kind to show progress and maybe have a GitHub issues dedicated to feature requests.

1. Start with a simple blog and styles

   - maybe do a little design work / simple logo for the MVP

2. Ecommerce store

   - the idea is to have a template store build with SolidStart + Postgres + Stripe + an email service to make money on the internet.
   - Having a blog and store is part of the formula of 'content + commerce' which can get a lot of people off the ground quickly
   - Once completed, the idea will be to open source a basic version for people to leverage. They will need to set up their own accounts with the services used but that will be the easy bit.

3. Start work on the services for _The Software Supply Co._

   - Goal setting / tracking: have a dashboard of to view and track your goals. It will be supported with...

   - ...integrations to calendars / todo / note-taking apps to help with learning + productivity. It will help to develop your knowledge system beyond what _The Software Supply Co._ can do.

   - Feed aggregator: to get the info you need in one place for podcast / social media / blog / rss feed. The idea is to help you be more focused and productive by displaying a sanitised feed bringing together the sources you care about. More signal, less noise.
   - follow your favourite content producers
   - remove the discoverability features from social media platforms that are addictive.

   - limits on number of items shown / time browsing

   - Community to share progress

   - subscription manager for learning platforms like Udemy/ codecademy/ egghead

   - links to jobs?
