# Why we donate to free code camp

We donate 10% of profits to Free Code Camp because:

- Knowledge empowers, I benefitted greatly from these free resouces, now it's my time to pay it forwards for others.
- Code is one of the greatest levers we can use to change the world and develop new tech. I want to share this with other by helping them to code and lift themselves up and change the world with their ideas.
- Free Code Camp is a very lean / efficient charitable organisation and I want support Quincy Larson to keep going with his mission.
